"""Did you know that although there are hundereds of antibiotics, they can be split into 6 categories! I've got a lot more information on this!""","""The 6 groups cover Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Aminoglycosides, Tetracyclines, Macrolides, Fluoroquinolones""","""Penicillins are used to treat infections such as skin infections, urinary tract infections and chest infections. Cephalosporins are known to be great for treating serious infections like meningitis and septicaemia. Aminoglycosides  are used in hospital but only for very serious illnesses such as septicaemia. They can cause some bad side effects which is why they are only used in hospitals mainly. Tetracyclines are very useful when it comes to skin conditions such as acne and rosacea. Macrolideswork well for chest and lung infections. They are also very useful for people who might be allergic to penicillin. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics were used a lot in the past and helped with a large range of infections. However, because of the bad side effects they aren't used that much anymore.""",,
"""Did you know that antibiotics are used when you have a bacterial infection.""","""Antibiotics are a chemical which can help your immune system fight and kill the bad bacteria. They can also slow the growth of that bacteria.""","""They can help you recover quickly but can't get rid of viruses like measles, chickenpox, colds and flu.""",,
"""There are lots of antibiotics around today. However, penicillin was the first antibiotic to be found. In fact, the scientific discovery was made in England, in 1928.""","""Alexander Fleming was the scientist who made the discovery from the UK whilst he was working in St. Mary's Hospital in London.""","""He had some bacteria called a Staphylococcus aureusa which he put on a petri dish. Alexander Fleming then realised that this bacteria had been killed by mould which was growing on the petri dish.""","""He realised it could dissolve bacteria! This is what he named penicillin. He called it this because the type of mould was called Penicillium.""",
"""Did you know that it is sometimes better to let your body fight for itself against illnesses!""","""Everyone has an immune system. Your immune system is there to fight off any bacteria or viruses that are attacking your body.  Sometimes it is best to let your body get rid of illnesses naturally. Your immune system will build up antibodies and will become stronger.""",,,
"""It's important that we don't use antibiotics too much otherwise the bacteria will become resistant!""","""Antibiotic resistance is becoming a big problem.Sometimes we might rely on antibiotics too much and use them when we don't need them. Doing this too much can make bacteria resistant to them, so when you really do need them they might not work.""","""Recently in an effort to stop this AMR the NHS has tried to stop giving them out for things like sore throats, chest infections and ear infections as your body is usually able to do the work for you.""",,
"""It is vital that you finish any dosage of antibiotics that have been prescribed to you by your doctor.""","""The reason for this is because antibiotics kill bacteria slowly, so even if you start to feel better, there might still be some bacteria left.""","""If you stop taking the antibiotics early, then the bacteria that is left might start to multiply and you will become ill again.""",,
"""Antibiotics don't just come in pill form. There are multiple ways you can take them. You can take them from tablets, capsules, liquid (that you drink), creams, sprays, drops, lotions, injections and a drip that goes directly into the blood.""",,,,
"""Did you know that there are over 100 different types of antibiotics!""",,,,
